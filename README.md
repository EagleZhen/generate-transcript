# Whisper Transcription Tool

A drag-and-drop tool for transcribing audio and video files using OpenAI Whisper, optimized for mixed Cantonese/English content.

## Features

- üéØ **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag audio/video files onto the script
- üó£Ô∏è **Cantonese Optimized**: Preserves colloquial Cantonese expressions
- üåè **Mixed Language**: Handles Cantonese + English naturally
- üìù **Dual Output**: Generates both SRT subtitles and clean markdown
- ‚ö° **CPU Processing**: Reliable, compatible operation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.13+** (or 3.8+)
2. **Poetry** for dependency management
3. **FFmpeg** for audio/video processing

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install FFmpeg (system-wide)
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg

# 2. Install Poetry (if not already installed)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# 3. Install project dependencies
poetry install

# 4. (Optional) Configure Poetry to create virtualenv in project directory
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

### Usage

```bash
# Drag & Drop (Windows/macOS)
# Simply drag your audio/video file onto transcribe.py

# Command Line
poetry run python transcribe.py your_audio_file.mp4

# Or activate the virtual environment first
poetry shell
python transcribe.py your_audio_file.mp4
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Install without development dependencies
poetry install --only main

# Show dependency tree
poetry show --tree

# Update dependencies
poetry update

# Add new dependency
poetry add package-name

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell

# Run script without activating environment
poetry run python transcribe.py audio.mp4
```

## Output Files

- **`filename.srt`** - Timestamped subtitles for video players
- **`filename.md`** - Clean markdown transcript for reading

## Supported Formats

- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, etc.
- **Video**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, etc. (audio extracted automatically)

## Performance

- **Current Mode**: CPU-only processing
- **Speed**: ~90-200 frames/s on i7-12700 (moderate but stable)
- **Quality**: High accuracy for Cantonese content
- **Memory**: ~2GB RAM usage

## Language Optimization

This tool is specifically tuned for:
- **Cantonese conversations** with natural colloquial expressions
- **Mixed Cantonese/English** (preserves English terms)
- **Traditional Chinese output** (when applicable)
- **Meeting recordings** and casual conversations

### Language Settings Trade-off

The tool uses `language="zh"` (Chinese) which provides:
- ‚úÖ Best transcription accuracy
- ‚úÖ Good mixed language handling
- ‚ùå More formal/written language style

Alternative `language="yue"` (Cantonese) would provide:
- ‚úÖ Better colloquial expression preservation
- ‚ùå Lower overall accuracy
- ‚ùå Occasional English translation instead of transcription

## Technical Details

- **Engine**: OpenAI Whisper (large model)
- **Processing**: CPU-only for compatibility
- **Transcription Settings**: Optimized for colloquial speech and mixed languages
- **Output Encoding**: UTF-8 for proper Chinese character support

## Known Limitations

- CPU-only processing (GPU acceleration disabled due to CUDA compatibility issues)
- No real-time transcription
- No speaker identification/diarization
- Mixed Simplified/Traditional Chinese characters in output

## Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg not found"
Install FFmpeg and ensure it's in your system PATH:
- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

### Slow processing
This is expected in CPU mode. Processing time depends on audio length and CPU performance.

### Poor transcription quality
- Ensure audio is clear and not too noisy
- Works best with conversational speech at normal volume
- Very quiet or heavily accented audio may have issues

## Future Improvements

- üöÄ **GPU Acceleration**: 3-5x speed improvement when CUDA compatibility issues are resolved
- üé§ **Speaker Diarization**: Separate speakers in conversations
- üîÑ **Real-time Processing**: Live transcription capabilities
